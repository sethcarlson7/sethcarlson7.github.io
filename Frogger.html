                        During the Spring quarter of my freshman year, the final assignment for my programming class was to code a game in C++ given your own specifications. I've always
                        really enjoyed playing retro arcade games and I saw this as an opportunity to recreate one of the classics: Frogger. The main difficulty was figuring out how to 
                        represent the lane objects, given that they interact differently with the frog and have their own lane velocity values. The solution was to make each lane its 
                        own predetermined pattern of objects and velocity, that the view loops through before wrapping around at the end. This was a fun project and improved my ability to 
                        execute a plan for development, even though my ability to actually play Frogger remains subpar.
