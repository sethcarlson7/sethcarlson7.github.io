                        During my senior year of highschool, I participated with a friend of mine in a self-directed program called Senior Experience. The goal of the program is to give students the freedom 
                        to explore a field of their choice, ours being computer science, while working under the close guidance of a teacher with relevant expertise. Throughout the fall, my friend and I 
                        solidifed our understanding of Python for software development and data visualization, with The Moving Puzzle being one of our projects. The idea came while we were Facetiming and I found
                        a vintage slide puzzle game in my grandmother's apartment that neither of us could figure out. We thought it'd be fun to recreate the game with Python and publish it on Replit for others to try.

                        The goal of the game is to move the black Piano tile to the bottom-left corner. Click on a piece with your mouse, then use the keypad to move it. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://replit.com/talk/share/The-Moving-Puzzle/126074">Click Here to Play!</a>
