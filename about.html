                    I'm Seth, a sophomore at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" class="clickable_org">Northwestern University</a> studying Computer Science and Creative Writing.

                    <p>
                        I've lived in Chicago my whole life and attended <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wyoung.org/" class="clickable_org">Whitney M. Young Magnet High School</a>. At Whitney, I was a varsity runner on the cross-country and track
                        teams for all four years, participated in and organized events for the school's Piano program, and served as a member of the National Honor Society.

                        Now attending Northwestern, the unconventional pairing of CS & Writing fulfills both the logical and creative aspects of my personality. For Computer Science, 
                        I look forward to exploring more advanced concepts in software development and AI. For Creative Writing, I plan on applying to the year-long intensive Fiction track where
                        I'll continue developing my craft by completing a novella. On campus, I've been apart of <a class="clickable_org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ieee.northwestern.edu/">IEEE</a> as well as <a class="clickable_org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rufnorthwestern.com/">RUF</a> and <a class="clickable_org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nucru.com/">Cru</a> where I've been able to grow deeper in my faith. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading, teaching judo at <a class="clickable_org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tohkon.com/">Tohkon Judo Academy</a>, and going on late-night walks with my dog.
